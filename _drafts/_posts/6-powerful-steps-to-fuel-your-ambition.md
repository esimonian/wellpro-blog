### 1. Connect to your inner ‘why’.

<span style="color: rgb(116, 116, 116); font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Connecting to your why, will help you to think more clearly, empower your relationships, broaden your windows of opportunity and most importantly it will fuel your energy and ambition. Your why is the reason you wake up every morning and do what you do day after day. When you truly connect to your inner why, you will never be the same again. Connecting to your why can sometimes happen through a process called journaling. Journaling is a type of writing where you just start writing all of your thoughts out on a paper at night before you go to bed. It continues on until your mind starts to see certain patterns and begins to have some clarity on what really matters most to you and what brings you down and further from yourself. Connecting to your why can also happen through inspiration when meditating. Some people connect to their why, via a life coach, who has professional techniques and processes designed to connect your to your life purpose or why</span><span style="color: rgb(116, 116, 116); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">.</span>

## 2. Establish healthy habits. 

- After we connect to our why, we feel inspired and it is a perfect time to start or improve your health and fitness routine. A regular health and fitness program, will prepare our body and mind for action towards your ambitions. We all want to feel our best. Don’t allow your sense of purpose and ambition to over-ride your requirement for physical health and fitness.

- Get adequate sleep. Sleep allows the body to operate at peak performance by deactivating harmful chemicals which are produced in the body during stress and little sleep. These chemicals damage your nervous system as well as your hormonal system and indicate that you are working at a sub level fuel for your ambition. Add to your diet lots of pure water which will rejuvenate your cells and improve blood levels and blood pressure when you are over challenged. Eat whole foods and remove all processed and heavily fried foods. This will help your body to lose weight, feel lighter and increase your sense of resolve for the day. Stop bad habits such as smoking which will further decrease your life expectancy and your resolve for a quality life.
