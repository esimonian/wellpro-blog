According to Shaffer-Hudson, a study of adolescents found that the overall perceived good physical health was strongly linked to life satisfaction and feeling excited, strong and proud. Those who said they felt lonelier, guiltier, more anxious and depressed and who were more likely to display undesirable behaviors reported being less healthy physically.

Neurolinguistic Hypnotherapy is an advanced form of guided meditation which allows us to access ordinary parts of our memory which are sometimes occluded from our day to day thoughts, but which impacts our moods, which in turn impacts our health and wellbeing.
